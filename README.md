# 🧠 C++ Algorithms & Problem Solving Projects

This repository contains **two C++ console projects**, each implemented in **two different ways**:

- **My Way** → learning-focused implementation
- **Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud’s Way** → professional and structured implementation

The purpose of this repository is to **compare problem-solving approaches**, improve algorithmic thinking, and strengthen C++ fundamentals.

## 🧮 Project 2: Math Game

### 📌 Description
A C++ console **math quiz game** that challenges the user with random math questions.

The program:
- Generates random math problems
- Supports different difficulty levels
- Tracks correct and wrong answers
- Displays final results and performance

### 🔁 Two Implementations

#### 🧑‍💻 My Way
- Learning-based implementation
- Clear step-by-step logic
- Focused on practicing:
  - Conditions
  - Loops
  - Functions
  - Random number generation

#### 👨‍🏫 Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud’s Way
- More organized and scalable design
- Uses structured programming techniques
- Cleaner logic flow and better abstraction
- Shows how professionals design console games
